This repo was built from scratch following the "Tech with Tim" YouTube video:

I used Abacus.ai to help solve issues with my development environment (VSCode), backend local development, and frontend local development.

I also used Abacus.ai to help solve deployment issues I had with Choreo using the "DEV" (free trial) tier.

I had more development challenges getting the frontend to work with the backend without errors, and getting the backend and front end components to build correctly on Choreo.
